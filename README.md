# Discord Lookup

Lookup a Discord User or Bot ID

# Getting started

- Latest version of Node.js is fine
- Create an application in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
  - Go the bot section and create a new bot
  - Copy your bot token 
- Rename `.env-example` to `.env`
  - Replace `*` with your bot token

Now you can run the script with

```shell
cd src/server
npm start or node index.js
```

# Badges

You can find all used Official Discord badges for this project in SVG files. (Discord Nitro, boosting server and partner badges are not available)
- Bot and Verified Bot badges may look different because they doesn't exist in the official Discord assets

# Aknowledgements

- [Discord](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/user#users-resource) for their docs and assets.
